        <p> CNN —  
It seems like we barely get done celebrating Mom when it’s time to give props to Dad. Indeed, Father’s Day is coming up fast. It falls on June 20 this year.

Maybe you’ve noticed something. On Mom, it seems, we go hard. But then the next month, we sometimes…phone it in. Literally. We give dear old dad a ring and call it a day. Stats bear that out. According to the National Retail Federation, Americans spend just about $8 billion more on Mother’s Day than Father’s Day. Now’s not the time to explore the cultural reasons for that, but we’re here to say it just ain’t right.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

Start giving your dad his due this year, right here. We have such great gift ideas for him and for all the special fathers in our lives, from new dads to granddads.</p>

<p>From unsightly notches to flip-up lenses, smartphone makers have devised all sorts of ways to incorporate front-facing cameras into their devices. But while many end up compromising the brand's aesthetic, Microsoft's new camera design is very, well, Microsoft.

The company has invented a new, colourful camera set up that leans into its branding – specifically the Windows-inspired four-square logo. A patent filing has revealed an under-display camera system based on the logo, with each square hiding a coloured lens. It could certainly make a novel addition to our best camera phones roundup.</p>
